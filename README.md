### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :house: I am currently working and living in Amsterdam. I don't speak Dutch but I can be a menace on my bicycle, so let's just say I'm incredibly integrated.
- I'm currently working as a software engineer for Passionate People ðŸ’…
- I no longer work for a bank. I was a full stack engineer on an internal application connecting data about its organisational structures, applications and people. The stack was VueJS/Express/Neo4J/K8S, with end-to-end tests written in Cypress. 
- ðŸ”­ Previously I was working on a product catalogue with super powers! We were leveraging Neo4J to build a graph of our data from different sources to help our colleagues find the information they need. I built the back-end (using neo4j-graphql-js and Apollo Server) and front-end (using React, TypeScript and Apollo Client). Tests were written with Jest/Testing Library/Cypress and it was type-safe from end-to-end :rocket:. Sometimes I wrote custom cypher or contributed to our loading scripts, and other times I was putting it all into Docker so we can spin up everything with a few simple commands. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about NodeJS (mainly using Express), microservice architecture, K8s and how to use some different databases (mainly Postgres, MongoDB and Neo4J). Further down the list...VueJS, Python, GitHub Actions and more SQL stuff.
