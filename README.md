### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :house: I am currently working and living in Amsterdam. I don't speak Dutch but I can be a menace on my bicycle, so let's just say I'm incredibly integrated.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a product catalogue with super powers! We've leveraging Neo4J to build a graph of our data from different sources to help our colleagues find the information they need. I've built the back-end (using neo4j-graphql-js and Apollo Server) and front-end (using React, TypeScript and Apollo Client). Tests are written with Jest/Testing Library/Cypress and it's type-safe from end-to-end :rocket:. Sometimes I write custom cypher or contribute to our loading scripts, and other times I'm putting it all into Docker so we can spin up everything with a few simple commands. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about NodeJS (mainly using Express), microservice architecture, K8s and how to use some different databases (mainly Postgres, MongoDB and Neo4J). Further down the list...VueJS, Python, GitHub Actions and more SQL stuff.
